## How to play

1. The player clicks an image at a time. If the image has not been clicked before, the player' score will be incremented by one, and when the player's score reaches to 12, the player wins. If the image has been clicked before, the player's score will be reset to 0, the player losses the game, and the game will be reset.

2. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.
